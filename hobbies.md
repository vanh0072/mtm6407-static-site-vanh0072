# My Hobbies

When I’m not working, I enjoy spending my free time exploring new activities and growing as a person. Here are a few things I love to do:

- **Photography**: Capturing the beauty around me through a lens.
- **Traveling**: Exploring new places and cultures around the world.
- **Reading**: Always learning with a good book. My current favorite genre is non-fiction, especially books on psychology and self-development.
- **Cooking**: Experimenting with new recipes and learning more about world cuisines.
- **Yoga & Meditation**: A way to relax and reconnect with myself.

Each of these activities helps me stay inspired and balanced, which fuels my creativity in my professional life as well.
